# Udacity - Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow
In here I put all of my work towards the projects. In order to graduate I completed three distinct projects.  

## 1. Project - Supervised Learning - Finding Donors
In this project, for a fictional organization called as CharityML, we try to find donors for their cause.  
  * Transform continuous features and normalizing.  
  * One-hot encoding
  * Evaluating supervised learning models 
  * Application of models
  * Improving results and model tuning
  * Feature importance

## 2. Project - Deep Learning - Image Classifier Project
In this project, I built a python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, then predict new images using the trained model.
  * Tensorflow and keras layers
  * Calculating training and validation accuracy and loss scores
  * Model saving and reusing
  * Use pre-trained network for inferance
  
## 3. Project - Unsupervised Learning - Identify Customer Segments
In this project, I identified clusters and segments in general demographic dataset and map them to the customer dataset.
  * Preprocess dataset.
    * Missing value to NaN convertion
    * Clean data from missing values
    * Re-encode features
    * Engineer new features from multi level features.
  * Feature scaling
  * Dimentionality reduction
  * Find clusters
  * Finding target customer demographic
